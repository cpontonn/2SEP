# Summary

Customizable Toolbox for Musculoskeletal simulation (CusToM) is a MATLAB toolbox aimed at performing inverse-dynamics-based musculoskeletal analyses [@Erdemir2007]. This type of analysis is essential to access mechanical quantities of human motion in different fields such as clinics, ergonomics and sports. CusToM exhibits several features. It can generate a personalized musculoskeletal model, and can solve from motion-capture data inverse kinematics, external forces estimation, inverse dynamics and muscle forces estimation problems as in various musculoskeletal simulation software [@Damsgaard2006; @Delp2007] (Figure \ref{Pipeline}).

According to user choices, the musculoskeletal model generation is achieved by using libraries containing pre-registered models [@Muller2015b]. These models consist of body parts of osteoarticular models, set of markers or set of muscles to be combined together. From an anthropometric based model, the geometric, inertial and muscular parameters are calibrated to fit the size and mass of the subject to be analyzed [@Muller2015a; @Muller2017; @Muller2017c]. The motion capture data (contained in a c3d file) are extracted with the Biomechanical ToolKit (BTK) [@Barre2014]. The inverse kinematics step computes joint coordinates trajectories against time [@Lu1999]. Joint torques are computed in an inverse dynamics step [@Featherstone2008]. To this end, external forces applied to the subject have to be known. They may be directly extracted from experimental data (as platform forces) or be estimated from motion data by using the equations of motion in an optimization scheme [@Fluit2014]. Lastly, muscle forces are estimated. It consists of finding a repartition of muscle forces respecting the joint torques and representing the central nervous system strategy [@Crowninshield1978; @Muller2017a; @Muller2018].

For a large set of musculoskeletal models and motion data, CusToM can easily perform all of the analyses described above. CusToM has been created as a modular tool to let the user be as free and autonomous as possible. 
The three model parts are defined as bricks customizable and adaptable with each other, namely the osteoarticular models, set of markers and set of muscles. The design or the modification of a musculoskeletal model is simplified with this modularity. Following the same idea, some methods are defined as adaptable bricks. Testing new cost functions in the optimization schemes, changing performance criteria or creating alternative motion analysis methods can be done in a relatively easy way.

The developement of a user interface facilitates the data management and the model definition during a given study.
